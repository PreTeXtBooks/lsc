    <title>Overview</title>
    <p>
      <em>Learning Statistics with CogStat</em> covers the contents of an introductory
      statistics class, as typically taught to undergraduate psychology students, focusing
      on the use of the CogStat statistical software. The book discusses basic statistical
      concepts and research design, followed by descriptive statistics and correlation.
      From a statistical theory perspective, the book covers probability, sampling and
      estimation, and null hypothesis testing. After introducing the theory, the book
      covers categorical data analysis, t-tests, ANOVAs, and regression. Bayesian
      statistics are covered at the end of the book.

      This book is intended for psychology students and other beginners who are interested
      in learning statistics and want to use CogStat to perform their analyses.

      and developed with the help of supporters. Its distinct advantage is automatic

      <em>Learning Statistics with CogStat</em> is a book which covers the contents of
      an introductory statistics class. It is an adaptation made by Róbert Fodor based
      on Danielle Navarro's original,
      <url href="https://learningstatisticswithr.com" visual="learningstatisticswithr.com">
        <em>Learning Statistics with R</em>
      </url>, version 0.6<fn>This book is compiled from scratch in bookdown but some code
      snippets rely on
      <url href="https://twitter.com/emilyandthelime" visual="twitter.com/emilyandthelime">Emily Kothe</url>'s
      bookdown adaptation of the original material (e.g. some knitr plots and tables
      appear in the source code without alteration), numbered as version
      <url href="https://learningstatisticswithr.com/book/" visual="learningstatisticswithr.com/book/">0.6.1</url>.</fn>.
      While the theory laid out in the original book is still valid, this book focuses
      on the practical application of statistical methods in CogStat. The book is not
      intended to be a comprehensive guide to either CogStat or statistical theory,
      though. One of the key challenges of the adaptation was to balance between a fully
      applied approach (like how CogStat handles analysis) and a theoretical one (like
      the fantastic textbook it is based on). Danielle's original content, while making
      up a massive chunk of the material, has been revised, reorganised, redacted,
      expanded on and rewritten to fit the new purpose.
    </p>
    <p>
      This book will always be a living thing. As CogStat expands and evolves, so will
      this book. If you have any suggestions, comments or questions, please feel free to

    <title>Foreword for the Second Edition</title>
    <p>
      This edition brings in plenty of changes, well beyond 10% of the book, which
      should warrant, per publishing standards, for it to be called <q>second
      edition</q>. The main drive behind these edits was reflections on the material's
      usefulness and <em>accuracy</em>, since some explanations and wordings needed to
      be more robust to withstand scientific scrutiny, which Attila Krajcsi provided.
      I must thank him for his helpful notes as consulting editor for this version, not
      due to sheer obligation but on account of genuine appreciation. His feedback was
      essential, and while I spent quite some time defending most of my earlier decisions
      (some of which I still do), I had to accept that I simply couldn't have got it
      quite right the first time, and I shouldn't be too attached to the source material.
      I loved that the original was accessible and the opposite of stuffy, but I decided
      to cut down plenty (mostly the chattiness) and replace it with, hopefully still
      accessible but scientifically more accurate parts. I consulted some other textbooks
      comparing the way they present the material for it not to be stuffy. I firmly
      believe scientific communication in all its forms needs to be in everyday language
      while using precise terminology, appropriate analogies, and accurate examples. I
      hope that this edition is something you, dear reader, will love to read. I hope
      this edition is a step in the right direction.

      <alert>Changelog:</alert>
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>Chapters on automatic statistical analysis and introduction to CogStat were
        amended and slightly expanded, and now they follow the chapter on research design,
        so that the reader can better appreciate automatic statistical analysis.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>The chapter on research design was largely rewritten <mdash/> particularly
        reliability and validity <mdash/> to make definitions more accurate, and examples
        are now related to health and psychology research. The rest of the chapter
        discussing bias and study design were scrapped due to their lack of relevance to
        the book's purpose.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>The chapter on exploring a variable was largely revised to tie to other
        statistics textbooks, also focusing on differentiating between population and
        sample measures.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>New: callout boxes added throughout some chapters to explain chart types and
        other concepts.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>New: definitions and examples are now presented markedly in the text.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>New: explanatory charts were added to the text.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Typos and minor errors were fixed all throughout the book.</p>
