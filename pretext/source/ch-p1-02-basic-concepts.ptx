  <title>Basic Concepts</title>

  <introduction>
    <p>
      In this chapter, we'll discuss basic concepts and terminology related to measurement and
      study design. Since this book focuses on data analysis, it won't give you enough information
      to design studies of your own. To do that, you'll need to take a course in research design
      and methods. There are a couple of good books on the topic.
    </p>
    <p>
      This chapter relies on Howitt and Cramer <xref ref="howittUnderstandingStatisticsPsychology2020"/>
      and Stevens <xref ref="Stevens1946"/> for discussing scales of measurement, and on
      Boncz <xref ref="bonczResearchMethodologyBasics2015"/>,
      Michalos <xref ref="michalosEncyclopediaQualityLife2014"/>, and

    <title>Introduction to Psychological Measurement</title>

    <p>
      First, data collection can be thought of as a kind of <alert>measurement</alert>. That is,
      what we're trying to do here is measure something about human behaviour or the human mind.
      What do we mean by <q>measurement</q>?
    </p>

    <p>
      Measurement as a concept comes down to finding some way of assigning numbers, labels, or
      other well-defined descriptions to phenomena. So, any of the following would count as a
      psychological measurement:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li><p>Danielle's <alert>age</alert> is <em>33 years</em>.</p></li>
      <li><p>She <em>does not</em> <alert>like anchovies</alert>.</p></li>
      <li><p>Her <alert>chromosomal gender</alert> is <em>male</em>.</p></li>
      <li><p>Her <alert>self-identified gender</alert> is <em>female</em>.</p></li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      In the short list above, the <alert>bolded part</alert> is <q>the thing to be measured</q>,
      and the <em>italicised part</em> is <q>the measurement itself</q>. We can expand on this a
      little bit by thinking about the set of possible measurements that could have arisen in each
      case:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>
          <alert>Age</alert> (in years) could have been <em>1, 2, 3 ... years</em>, etc. The
          upper bound on what the age could be is a bit fuzzy, but in practice, you'd be safe in
          saying that the largest possible age is <em>150</em> since no human has ever lived that
          long. And age doesn't really have a true zero, but that is not important just yet.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          When asked if someone <alert>likes anchovies</alert>, they might say <em>I do</em>,
          <em>I do not</em>, <em>I have no opinion</em>, or <em>I sometimes do</em>.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          <alert>Chromosomal gender</alert> is almost certainly going to be
          <em>male (XY)</em> or <em>female (XX)</em>, but there are a few other possibilities:
          with <em>Klinefelter's syndrome (XXY)</em>, it is more similar to male than to female.
          And there are other possibilities, too.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          <alert>Self-identified gender</alert> is also very likely to be <em>male</em> or
          <em>female</em>, <em>transgender</em>, <em>nonbinary</em>, <em>queer</em> etc.
        </p>
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      As you can see, for some things, like age, it seems pretty apparent what the set of possible
      measurements should be, whereas, for other things, it gets a bit tricky. But even regarding
      someone's age, it's a bit more subtle. For instance, if you're a developmental psychologist,
      measuring in <em>years</em> is way too crude, and so you often measure age in
      <em>years and months</em> (if a child is 2 years and 11 months, this is usually written as
      <q>2;11</q>). If you're interested in newborns, you might want to measure age in
      <em>days since birth</em>, or maybe even <em>hours since birth</em>.
    </p>

    <p>
      Looking at this a bit more closely, you might also realise that the concept of <q>age</q>
      isn't all that precise. Generally, when we say <q>age</q>, we implicitly mean <q>the length
      of time since birth</q>. But that's not always the right way to do it.
    </p>

    <p>
      Suppose you're interested in how newborn babies control their eye movements. If Baby Alice
      is born 3 weeks premature and Baby Bianca is born 1 week late, would it really make sense
      to say that they are the <q>same age</q> if we encountered them <q>2 hours after birth</q>?
      In a sense, yes. By social convention, we use birth as our reference point for talking about
      age in everyday life since it defines the amount of time the person has been operating as an
      independent entity in the world. But from a scientific perspective, that's not the only
      thing we care about. You might want to measure age from conception, and voilà, you're already
      thinking about all the potential problems with analysis and comparisons. When we think about
      the biology of human beings, it's often helpful to think of ourselves as organisms that have
      been growing and maturing since conception. From that perspective, Alice and Bianca aren't
      the same age at all. So you might want to define the concept of <q>age</q> in two different
      ways: the length of time since conception and the length of time since birth. It won't make
      much difference when dealing with adults, but when dealing with newborns, it might. In other
      words, how you specify the allowable measurement values is important.
    </p>

    <p>
      Still, there's the question of methodology. What specific measurement <alert>method</alert>
      will you use to find out someone's age? There are several options:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>
          You could just ask people, <q>how old are you?</q> The method of <em>self-report</em>
          is fast, cheap and easy, but it only works with people old enough to understand the
          question, and some people lie about their age.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          You could ask an authority (e.g. a parent), <q>how old is your child?</q> This method
          is fast, and it's not all that hard when dealing with kids since the parent is almost
          always around. It doesn't work as well if you want to know <q>age since conception</q>
          since a lot of parents can't say for sure when conception took place. You might need a
          different authority (e.g. an obstetrician).
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          You could look up official records, like birth certificates. This is time-consuming and
          annoying, but it has its uses (e.g. if the person is now dead).
        </p>
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      All of the ideas discussed in the previous section relate to the concept of
      <alert>operationalisation</alert>. To be a bit more precise about the idea,
      operationalisation is the process by which we take a meaningful but somewhat vague concept
      and turn it into an accurate measurement. The method of operationalisation can involve
      several different things:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>
          For instance, does <q>age</q> mean <q>time since birth</q> or <q>time since
          conception</q> in the context of your research?
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Will you use self-report to measure age, ask a parent, or look up an official record?
          If you're using self-report, how will you phrase the question?
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Defining the set of allowable values that the measurement can take. Note that these
          values don't always have to be numerical, though they often are. When measuring age,
          the values are numerical, but we still need to think carefully about what numbers are
          allowed. Do we want age in years, years and months, days, or hours? The values aren't
          numerical for other types of measurements (e.g. gender). But, as before, we need to
          consider what values are allowed. If we're asking people to self-report their gender,
          what options do we allow them to choose from? Is it enough to allow only <q>male</q> or
          <q>female</q>? Do you need an <q>other</q> option? Or should we not give people any
          specific options and let them answer in their own words? And if you open up the set of
          possible values to include all verbal responses, how will you interpret their answers?
        </p>
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      Operationalisation is tricky, and there's no <q>one, true way</q> to do it. How you
      operationalise the informal concept of <q>age</q> or <q>gender</q> into a formal measurement
      depends on what you need to use the measurement for. You'll often find that the community of
      scientists who work in your area have some well-established ideas for how to go about it.
      Tip: when working on your dissertation, consult your supervisor and the literature to see
      what the community has settled on.
    </p>

    <p>
      In other words, operationalisation needs to be thought through case-by-case. Nevertheless,
      while there are a lot of issues that are specific to each individual research project, there
      are some aspects to it that are pretty general.
    </p>

    <p>
      Let's take a moment to clear up our terminology and, in the process, introduce one more
      term. Here are four different things that are closely related to each other:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>
          <em>A clear construct</em>. This is the concept that you're trying to measure, like
          <q>age</q>, <q>gender</q>, or an <q>opinion</q>.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          <em>A measure</em>. The measure refers to the method or instrument used to make your
          observations. A question in a survey, a behavioural observation or a brain scan could
          all count as a measure.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          <em>Operationalisation</em>. This is the logical connection between the measure and the
          theoretical construct: a definition of how you assign value to the concept (calculation,
          range, level of measurement etc.).
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          <em><alert>A variable</alert></em>. Finally, a new term. A variable is the outcome of
          the measurement process.
        </p>
      </li>
    </ul>

    <example xml:id="ex-operationalisation">
      <title>Method</title>
      <p>Here's an example:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>
            Construct: attitude towards Prince Harry the Duke of Sussex (the underlying concept)
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Measure: 5-point Likert scale in a self-report survey (instrument)
          </p>

          <p>
            Operationalisation: survey a sample of UK online newsreaders and ask them to rate
            their level of agreement on a 5-point Likert scale with the following statement:
            <q>I personally find Prince Harry the Duke of Sussex an agreeable person</q><fn>Is
            this most relevant sentence that accurately represents the concept you want to
            measure?</fn>.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>

            e.g., 5: <q>strongly agree</q>...

    <title>Measurement Levels</title>

    <p>
      As the previous section indicates, the outcome of a psychological measurement is called a
      variable. But not all variables are of the same qualitative type, and it's handy to
      understand what types there are. A very useful concept for distinguishing between different
      types of variables is what's known as <alert>scales of measurement</alert>, or in CogStat
      terminology, <alert>measurement levels</alert>.
    </p>

    <subsection xml:id="subsec-nominal">
      <title>Nominal Categories</title>

      <definition xml:id="def-nominal">
        <title>Nominal scale variable</title>
        <statement>
          <p>
            A <alert>nominal scale variable</alert> (also referred to as a
            <alert>categorical variable</alert>) is the results of a <em>qualitative</em>
            measurement, where the number of possible values are limited and fixed; they represent
            a name, a label, a classification, or non-overlapping categories; and there is no
            order, hierarchy or ranking between the categories. E.g. eye colour, place of
            residence, gender.
          </p>
        </statement>
      </definition>

      <p>
        For these kinds of variables, it doesn't make any sense to say that one of them is
        <q>bigger</q> or <q>better</q> than any other one, and it doesn't make any sense to
        average them. The classic example for this is <q>eye colour</q>. Eyes can be blue, green
        and brown, among other possibilities, but none of them is any <q>better</q> than any other
        one. As a result, it would feel bizarre to talk about an <q>average eye colour</q>.
        Similarly, gender is nominal too: <em>male</em> isn't better or worse than <em>female</em>,
        neither does it make sense to try to talk about an <q>average gender</q>. In short, nominal
        scale variables are those for which the only thing you can say about the different
        possibilities is that they are different. That's it.
      </p>

      <p>
        Note that sometimes nominal variables will have numbers coded to them usually for technical
        reasons (e.g., in survey data outputs). E.g., 1: male, 2: female, 3: nonbinary... This is
        a common practice, but the variable is still nominal: the numbers are just a way of
        representing the categories, and you should never, ever, ever (!) analyse them as if they
        were numerical/score measurements.
      </p>

      <example xml:id="ex-nominal">
        <title>Nominal scale variable example</title>
        <p>
          Suppose we were researching how people commute to and from work. One variable we would
          have to measure would be what kind of transportation people use to get to work. This
          <q>transport type</q> variable could have quite a few possible values, including:
          <q>train</q>, <q>bus</q>, <q>car</q>, <q>bicycle</q>, etc. For now, let's suppose that
          these four are the only possibilities, and suppose that when we ask 100 people how they
          got to work today, we get this:
        </p>

        <table xml:id="table-transportation1">
          <title/>
          <tabular halign="center">
            <row header="yes">
              <cell halign="left">Transportation</cell>
              <cell>Number of people</cell>
            </row>
            <row>
              <cell halign="left">Train</cell>
              <cell>12</cell>
            </row>
            <row>
              <cell halign="left">Bus</cell>
              <cell>30</cell>
            </row>
            <row>
              <cell halign="left">Car</cell>

              <cell>10</cell>
            </row>
          </tabular>
        </table>

        <p>
          So, what's the <em>average transportation type</em>? Obviously, the answer here is that
          there isn't one. You can say that travel by car is the <em>most popular method</em>, and
          travel by train is the <em>least popular method</em>, but that's about all. That is
          based on the <em>frequency</em> of the occurrence (i.e., count). Similarly, notice that
          the order in which the options are listed isn't very exciting. We could have chosen to
          display the data like this:
        </p>

        <table xml:id="table-transportation2">

        <statement>
          <p>
            An <alert>ordinal scale variable</alert> or <alert>rank</alert> is the results of a
            measurement, where there is a natural, meaningful way to order or rank the different
            outcome possibilities. E.g. finishing position in a race, education status.
          </p>
        </statement>
      </definition>

      <p>
        The <em>quantitative</em> difference between the outcomes might be unknown or uneven.
        E.g. education status: finishing elementary school takes 8 years in Europe, while an
        undergraduate degree is usually 3 years long; or you <em>can</em> say that the person who
        finished first was faster than the person who finished second, but you don't know the
        exact difference (unless you had a <q>finished at</q> timestamp data, which in turn is no
        longer an ordinal variable anymore). The important thing is that there is a natural,
        meaningful way to <em>order the outcomes</em>, but we don't <em>quantify</em> the
        difference between them.
      </p>

      <p>
        Note that you can have a numeric code assigned to an ordinal variable. However, do not
        process these numbers as if they were meaningful beyond them representing an order. E.g.,
        if you have a variable that measures the level of education, and you code it as
        1: elementary school, 2: high school, 3: undergraduate degree, 4: graduate degree, but
        the variable still represents an order (i.e., level): you cannot add, subtract, divide or
        multiply these numbers.

          Suppose we're interested in people's attitudes to climate change, and we ask them to
          pick one of these four statements that most closely matches their beliefs:
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li><p>Temperatures are rising because of human activity</p></li>
          <li><p>Temperatures are rising, but we don't know why</p></li>
          <li><p>Temperatures are rising, but not because of humans</p></li>
          <li><p>Temperatures are not rising</p></li>
        </ol>
        <p>
          Notice that these four statements actually do have a natural ordering in terms of
          <q>the extent to which they agree with the current science</q>. Statement 1 is a close
          match, statement 2 is a suitable match, statement 3 isn't a perfect match, and statement
          4 strongly opposes science. So, in terms of the thing we're interested in (the extent to
          which people endorse the science), we can order the items as 1 &gt; 2 &gt; 3 &gt; 4.
          Since this ordering exists, it would be peculiar to list the options like this:
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li value="3"><p>Temperatures are rising, but not because of humans</p></li>

          When analysing these data, it seems quite reasonable to try to group (1), (2) and (3)
          together and say that 81 of 100 people were willing to <em>at least partially</em>
          endorse the science. And it's <em>also</em> quite reasonable to group (2), (3) and (4)
          together and say that 49 of 100 people registered <em>at least some disagreement</em>
          with the dominant scientific view. However, it would be entirely bizarre to try to group
          (1), (2) and (4) together and say that 90 of 100 people said what? There's nothing
          sensible that allows you to group those responses together at all.
        </p>
        <p>
          That said, notice that while we <em>can</em> use the natural ordering of these items to
          construct sensible groupings, what we <em>can't</em> do is average them. For instance,
          in our simple example here, the <q>average</q> response to the question is 1.97. We
          would love to know if someone can tell us what that means.

        In contrast to nominal and ordinal scale variables, the <em>differences</em> between the

          Suppose we're interested in looking at how the attitudes of first-year university
          students have changed over time, and we need to capture the <em>year they started</em>.
          This is an interval scale variable. A student who started in 2003 did arrive 5 years
          before a student who started in 2008. However, it would be completely insane to divide
          2008 by 2003 and say that the second student started <q>1.0024 times later</q> than the

        The fourth and final type of variable to consider is a ratio scale variable, in which zero

        absolute zero), but that sadly means that you are likely dead. Kelvin is a ratio scale
        variable, because it has a true zero (absolute zero), and 100 K means truly twice as much

      <title>The Special Case of the Likert Scale</title>

      <p>
        The humble Likert scale is all survey designs' bread and butter tool. You have filled out
        hundreds, maybe thousands of them, and odds are you've even used one yourself. Suppose we
        have a survey question that looks like this:
      </p>

      <blockquote>
        <p>
          Which of the following best describes your opinion of the statement that <q>all pirates
          are awesome</q> ...
        </p>
      </blockquote>

      <p>and then, the options presented to the participant are these:</p>

      <ol>
        <li><p>Strongly disagree</p></li>
        <li><p>Disagree</p></li>
        <li><p>Neither agree nor disagree</p></li>
        <li><p>Agree</p></li>
        <li><p>Strongly agree</p></li>
      </ol>

      <p>
        This set of items is an example of a 5-point Likert scale: people are asked to choose
        among one of several (in this case, 5) clearly ordered possibilities, generally with a
        verbal descriptor given in each case. However, it's not necessary that all items be
        explicitly described. This is a perfect example of a 5-point Likert scale too:
      </p>

      <ol>
        <li><p>Strongly disagree</p></li>
        <li><p/></li>
        <li><p/></li>
        <li><p/></li>
        <li><p>Strongly agree</p></li>
      </ol>

      <p>
        Likert scales are convenient, if somewhat limited, tools. The question is, what kind of
        variable are they? They're obviously discrete since you can't give a response of 2.5.
        They're obviously not nominal scale since the items are ordered, and they're not ratio
        scale either since there's no natural zero<fn>And you can't cheat. You can code your
        Likert scale from 0 to 4 instead of 1 to 5, but these are arbitrary, just like deciding
        that the freezing temperature is labelled as 0.</fn>.
      </p>

      <p>
        But are they ordinal scale or interval scale? One argument says that we can't prove that
        the difference between <q>strongly agree</q> and <q>agree</q> is of the same size as the
        difference between <q>agree</q> and <q>neither agree nor disagree</q>. In fact, in
        everyday life, it's pretty apparent they're not the same. So this suggests that we ought
        to treat Likert scales as ordinal variables. On the other hand, we can argue that some
        participants will take the whole <q>on a scale from 1 to 5</q> part seriously, and they
        tend to act as if the differences between the five response options were equidistant. While
        theoretically it is not an interval scale, researchers treat it as a
        <alert>quasi-interval scale</alert>.

        There's a second kind of distinction that you need to be aware of regarding what types of
        variables you can run into. This is the distinction between <em>continuous</em> and
        <em>discrete</em> data types.

            A <alert>continuous variable</alert> can take on any value on a spectrum, and it's

          Response time is continuous. If Alan takes 3.1 seconds and Ben takes 2.3 seconds to
          respond to a question, then Cameron's response time can lie in between by taking
          3.0 seconds. And, of course, it would also be possible for David to take 3.031 seconds
          to respond, meaning that his RT would lie in between Cameron's and Alan's. And while in
          practice, it might be impossible to measure RT that precisely, it's certainly possible
          in principle. Because we can always find a new value for RT in between any two other
          ones, we say that RT is continuous.

          Nominal scale variables are always discrete: there isn't a type of transportation that

          Similarly, ordinal scale variables are always discrete: although <q>2nd place</q> does
          fall between <q>1st place</q> and <q>3rd place</q>, there's nothing that can logically

          Interval scale and ratio scale variables can go either way. Temperature in degrees
          Celsius (an interval scale variable) is also continuous; however, the year you went to
          school (an interval scale variable) is discrete. There's no year between 2002 and 2003.
          The number of questions you get right on a true-or-false test (a ratio scale variable)
          is also discrete: since a true-or-false question doesn't allow you to be <q>partially
          correct</q>, there's nothing in between 5/10 and 6/10.
        </p>
      </example>

        Note that some people might say <q>discrete variable</q> when they mean <q>nominal scale
        variable</q>. While all nominal scale variables are discrete, not all discrete variables

    <title>Independent and Dependent Variables</title>

    <p>
      Usually, when we do some research, we end up with lots of different variables. Then, when
      we analyse our data, we often try to explain some of the variables in terms of the other
      variables. It's essential to keep the two roles, <q>thing doing the explaining</q> and
      <q>thing being explained</q>, distinct. So let's be clear about this now. Firstly, we might
      as well get used to the idea of using mathematical symbols to describe variables since it's
      going to happen repeatedly. Let's denote the <q>to be explained</q> variable <m>Y</m>, and
      the variables <q>doing the explaining</q> as <m>X_1</m>, <m>X_2</m>, etc.
    </p>

    <p>
      Now, when we are doing analysis, we have different names for <m>X</m> and <m>Y</m>, since
      they play different roles. The classical names for these roles are
      <alert>independent variable</alert> (IV) and <alert>dependent variable</alert> (DV). The IV
      is the variable you use to explain (i.e., <m>X</m>) and the DV is the variable being
      explained (i.e., <m>Y</m>). The logic behind these names goes like this: if there is a
      relationship between <m>X</m> and <m>Y</m>, then we can say that <m>Y</m> depends on
      <m>X</m>, and if we have designed our study <q>properly</q>, then <m>X</m> isn't dependent
      on anything else. However, those names are horrible: they're hard to remember, and they're
      highly misleading because (a) the IV is never actually <q>independent of everything else</q>
      and (b) if there's no relationship, then the DV doesn't actually depend on the IV. And,
      because we're not the only people who think that IV and DV are just awful names, there are
      several alternatives that some find more appealing. The terms used in these notes are
      <em><alert>predictors</alert></em> and <em><alert>outcomes</alert></em>. The idea here is
      that you're trying to use <m>X</m> (the predictors) to make guesses about <m>Y</m> (the
      outcomes). This is summarised in <xref ref="table-ivdv"/>.

    <title>Reliability</title>

    <p>
      By applying psychological measures we end up with variables, which can come in many
      different types. But the inevitable question arises: is the measurement any good? We'll do
      this in terms of two related ideas: <em>reliability</em> and <em>validity</em>.
    </p>

    <definition xml:id="def-reliability">
      <title>Reliability</title>
      <statement>
        <p>
          The <alert>reliability</alert> of a measure is the extent to which it is dependably,
          consistently, and stably giving the same result when measuring the same observation.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </definition>

    <example xml:id="ex-reliability-a">
      <title>Reliability example A</title>
      <p>
        You are designing a health psychology experiment to test the effect of psilocybin on mood
        disorders<fn>Read up on actual research on dosing, if interested. At the time of writing,
        this is an excellent starting point: Garcia-Romeu et al.
        <xref ref="garcia-romeuOptimalDosingPsilocybin2021"/>.</fn>. You are trying to find the
        right bodyweight-adjusted dose. You have a scale in the lab in Room A. You ask a
        participant to step on and you read 65 kg. For some reason, within a minute (in which they
        didn't drink, eat or go to the bathroom), you have to ask them to step back, but this time,
        the scale shows 74 kg. Disbelief creeps in, rightly. You are confused, and you decide to
        ask them to step on the scale again. This time, the scale shows 65 kg. Can you trust this
        65 kg reading?
      </p>
      <p>
        You borrow a scale from Room B and ask the same participant to step on it -- again, within
        a minute or two, so no weight shift should occur. This time, the scale shows 68 kg after
        three consecutive readings. But can you trust this 68 kg reading? You have your doubts.
        So you go into Room C, which has a different type of scale. The participant steps on the
        scale three times, and it consistently shows 68 kg.
      </p>
    </example>

    <example xml:id="ex-reliability-b">
      <title>Reliability example B</title>
      <p>
        You have a patient admitted to a ward, and you and your colleague are asked to evaluate
        them. You both use the same version of the Questionnaire X, still within the same time of
        day, but you both end up with different scores and different diagnoses. Can you trust either
        of your scores?
      </p>
      <p>
        A senior colleague provides you with SCID-5, a structured clinical interview for diagnosing
        mental disorders based on DSM-5. You use it to evaluate the patient. You both get a
        diagnosis of major depressive disorder.
      </p>
    </example>

    <p>
      The examples already hints at different ways of thinking about reliability, but let's
      summarise what the different types of reliability might be:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>
          <em><alert>Test-retest</alert></em> or <em><alert>temporal reliability</alert></em>.
          This relates to consistency over time: if we repeat the measurement on the same thing at
          a later date, do we get the same answer? In <xref ref="ex-reliability-a"/>, the scale in
          Room A was not reliable, but the scale in Room B and Room C was.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          <em><alert>Interrater reliability</alert></em>. This relates to consistency across
          people: if someone else repeats the measurement, will they produce the same answer? In
          <xref ref="ex-reliability-b"/>, the two raters gave different answers with the same
          Questionnaire X, so clearly it was not reliable in this sense, however the SCID-5
          was<fn>SCID-5 is a golden standard, but it is not fully void of inter-rater reliability
          issues, particularly among recently trained clinicians (Brodey et al.
          <xref ref="brodeyValidationNetSCIDAutomated2016"/>), however, there are always new tools
          or versions to help tackle this.</fn>. If this fails, the instrument is subjective.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          <em><alert>Internal consistency reliability</alert></em> or
          <em><alert>homogeneity</alert></em>. Suppose a measurement is constructed from many
          different parts that perform similar functions. Inventories and scales use multiple
          questions to measure a single concept. If the questions are all measuring the same thing,
          then they should be consistent with each other. Ideally, items relating to the same
          concept should be highly correlated with each other, i.e., they should be consistent
          with each other<fn>Of course if some items are too highly correlated, one or two of them
          might even be redundant to be dropped while keeping the overall consistency high. However,
          we won't cover in detail survey design in this book.</fn>.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          <em><alert>Parallel/alternative forms reliability</alert></em>. This relates to
          consistency across theoretically-equivalent measurements. In
          <xref ref="ex-reliability-a"/>, the scales in both Room B and Room C gave the same
          reading. Two different <q>versions</q> of a measurement instrument were used to measure
          the same concept (human body weight), and they gave the same answer<fn>Making different
          versions of the same test, e.g. by switching up the order of items is one possible way
          to test for reliability.</fn>.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          <em><alert>Split-half reliability</alert></em>. This is a very specific concept widely
          used in survey design: divide a test into two halves, and see if the two halves are
          consistent with each other by calculating the reliability coefficient.
        </p>
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      Not all measurements need to possess all forms of reliability. Nevertheless, it is important
      to be aware of reliability as a concept with its forms. CogStat will help you with analysing
      internal consistency and interrater reliability as of version 2.4+, but we will cover the
      tutorial once we understand how to compare two groups of data
      (<xref ref="ch-correlation"/>).

    <title>Validity</title>

    <p>
      More than any other thing, a scientist wants their research to be <q>valid</q>. The
      conceptual idea behind validity is simple: can you trust the results of your study? In
      practice, there are different kinds of validity, each of which raises its own issues, and
      not all forms of validity are relevant to all studies.
    </p>

    <p>
      While validity is a research methodology subject and not a statistical one, some forms of
      validity are measured using statistical methods. So let's talk about different kinds of
      validity briefly, in a somewhat particular order.
    </p>

    <definition xml:id="def-content-validity">
      <title>Content validity</title>
      <statement>
        <p>
          The <alert>content validity</alert> is the extent to which an instrument measures the
          desired concept or construct comprehensively (with no gaps or missing aspects) and
          accurately (with no irrelevant or misleading domains).
        </p>
      </statement>
    </definition>

    <p>Some typical questions would be:</p>

    <ul>
      <li><p>Are all important domains of the concept we want to measure covered?</p></li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Does the selected instrument measure the same concept that we are trying to measure in
          all its aspects?
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Are there any items in the instrument that are not relevant to the concept we are trying
          to measure?
        </p>
      </li>
      <li><p>What biases might be present in the instrument?</p></li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Is the instrument culturally sensitive? Is the instrument reliable and consistent across
          different subgroups of the population?
        </p>
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      A subjective judgement of content validity is called face validity.
    </p>

    <definition xml:id="def-face-validity">
      <title>Face validity</title>
      <statement>
        <p>
          The <alert>face validity</alert> of a study is the extent to which the measurement of a
          variable <q>looks like</q> it's measuring the correct theoretical construct, but it is a
          subjective judgement.

      <li><p>Does the instrument look like it's measuring the right thing?</p></li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Will the participant recognise the construct that we are trying to measure? (This might
          lead to cases where the participant fakes the response.)
        </p>
      </li>
    </ul>

    <definition xml:id="def-construct-validity">
      <title>Construct validity</title>
      <statement>
        <p>
          The <alert>construct validity</alert> is the extent to which the measurement of a
          variable is consistent with the theoretical construct that it is supposed to measure.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </definition>

    <p>Typical questions you might consider:</p>

    <ul>
      <li><p>Is the construct defined in a way that is clear and unambiguous?</p></li>
      <li><p>Is the construct defined too broadly or too narrowly?</p></li>
      <li><p>Is the sample and method appropriate for the construct?</p></li>
      <li>
        <p>
          How does this instrument relate to other instruments designed to measure the same
          construct?
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Does the instrument produce the same expected results as other instruments designed to
          measure the same construct?
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Does the instrument predict other variables that are theoretically related to the
          construct?
        </p>
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      To test for construct validity, we can test for discriminant validity<fn>Sometimes referred
      to as <em>divergent validity</em>. This, however, is not a universally accepted terminology
      (Hubley <xref ref="hubleyDivergentValidity2014"/>).</fn> through correlation and factor

      <p>
        You are researching the relationship between socio-economic status and health outcomes.
        The health outcome is the construct of interest, it is the dependent variable. The
        socio-economic status is the independent variable. You are interested in the relationship
        between the two, and you want to know if socio-economic status is a good predictor of
        health outcomes.
      </p>
      <p>
        There are a number of related variables that you could use to measure socio-economic
        status, such as: personal income, household income, education, occupation, and so on. You
        could use any of these variables to measure socio-economic status, but you want to know
        which one is the best predictor of health outcomes. You could test for the relationship
        between each of these variables and health outcomes, and then choose the one that has the
        highest correlation coefficient. This is a form of convergent validity.
      </p>
      <p>
        There are unrelated variables that have an effect on health outcomes, such as: environment,
        gender, disability and impairments, minority status, family history of diseases, and so on.
        If the unrelated variables demonstrate a weak correlation with the socio-economic status
        variables, then this is a form of discriminant validity.

        <xref ref="taylorHealthPsychology2021"/>).</fn>, disability, and minority status as
        variables would likely have a stronger than weak correlation with socio-economic status.
        These are called <alert>confounding variables</alert>. They are variables that are related
        to both the independent and dependent variables, and they can affect the results of the
        study. You'll need to control for these variables in your study design.

        However, still many statistics and research methodology textbooks used today, particularly
        the ones that are used to create this chapter, use the historical terminology.

    <p>
      This chapter isn't really meant to provide a comprehensive discussion of psychological
      research methods: it would require another volume just as long as this one does justice to
      the topic. However, in real life, statistics and study design are tightly intertwined, so
      discussing some key topics is convenient. In this chapter, we've briefly discussed the
      following:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>
          <em>Measurement</em> (<xref ref="sec-measurement"/>). What does it mean to operationalise
          a theoretical construct? What does it mean to have variables and take measurements?
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          <em>Scales of measurement and variable types</em> (<xref ref="sec-scales"/>). Remember
          that there are <em>two</em> different distinctions here: there's the difference between
          discrete and continuous data, and there's the difference between the four different scale
          types (nominal, ordinal, interval and ratio).
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          <em>Terminology: predictors and outcomes</em> (<xref ref="sec-ivdv"/>). What roles do
          variables play in an analysis? Can you remember the difference between predictors and
          outcomes? Dependent and independent variables? Etc.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          <em>Reliability</em> (<xref ref="sec-reliability"/>). Can you trust your results? How do
          you know that your measurements are consistent?
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          <em>Validity</em> (<xref ref="sec-validity"/>). Does your study measure what you want
          it to?
        </p>
