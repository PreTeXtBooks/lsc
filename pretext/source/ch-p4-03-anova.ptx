  <title>Comparing Several Means (One-Way ANOVA)</title>

  <introduction>
    <p>
      This chapter introduces one of the most widely used statistical tools known as "the analysis
      of variance", which is usually referred to as ANOVA. Sir Ronald Fisher developed the basic
      technique in the early 20th century, and it is to him that we owe the rather unfortunate
      terminology.
    </p>

    <p>
      The term ANOVA is a little misleading in two respects. Firstly, although the technique's
      name refers to variances, ANOVA is concerned with investigating differences in means.
      Secondly, several different things out there are all referred to as ANOVAs, some of which
      have only a very tenuous connection to one another. Later in the book, we'll encounter
      various ANOVA methods that apply in quite different situations. Still, for this chapter,
      we'll only consider the simplest form of ANOVA, in which we have several different groups of
      observations. We're interested in finding out whether those groups differ in terms of some
      outcome variable of interest. This is the question that is addressed by a <term>one-way
      ANOVA</term>.
    </p>

    <p>
      After introducing the data, we'll describe the mechanics of the one-way ANOVA, how to
      calculate effect sizes and post hoc tests. We'll also talk about how to check for normality
      and homoscedasticity.
    </p>

    <p>
      Now let's run a clinical trial!
    </p>
  </introduction>

  <section xml:id="sec-anova-data">
    <title>The Data</title>

    <p>
      Suppose you've become involved in a clinical trial in which you are testing a new
      antidepressant drug called <em>Joyzepam</em>. In order to construct a fair test of the
      drug's effectiveness, the study involves three different medications to be administered. One
      is a placebo, and the other is an existing antidepressant / anti-anxiety drug called
      <em>Anxifree</em>. A collection of 18 participants with moderate to severe depression are
      recruited for your initial testing. Because the drugs are sometimes administered in
      conjunction with psychological therapy, your study includes 9 people undergoing cognitive
      behavioural therapy (CBT) and 9 who are not. Participants are randomly assigned (doubly
      blinded, of course) a treatment, such that there are 3 CBT people and 3 no-therapy people
      assigned to each of the 3 drugs. A psychologist assesses the mood of each person after a 3
      month run with each drug: and the overall <em>improvement</em> in each person's mood is
      assessed on a scale ranging from <m>-5</m> to <m>+5</m>.
    </p>

    <p>
      With that as the study design, let's load our data file: <c>clinicaltrial.csv</c>. We have
      three variables: <c>drug</c>, <c>therapy</c> and <c>mood_gain</c>. Next, let's print the
      data frame to get a sense of what the data actually look like.
    </p>

    <p>
      For the purposes of this chapter, what we're really interested in is the effect of
      <c>drug</c> on <c>mood_gain</c>. The first thing to do is use the <c>Compare groups</c>
      function. (But don't jump ahead by adding both <c>drug</c> and <c>therapy</c> to the
      <c>Group(s)</c> box. That's going to be our factorial ANOVA in the next chapter.)
    </p>

    <figure xml:id="fig-moodbydrug">
      <caption>Mood gain by drug.</caption>
      <image source="moodbydrug.png"/>
    </figure>

    <p>
      The results are shown in the boxplot in <xref ref="fig-moodbydrug"/>, which plots the
      average mood gain for all three conditions; error bars show upper and lower quartile. As the
      plot makes clear, there is a larger improvement in mood for participants in the Joyzepam
      group than for either the Anxifree group or the placebo group. The Anxifree group shows a
      larger mood gain than the control (i.e. placebo) group, but the difference isn't as large.
    </p>

    <p>
      The question that we want to answer is: are these difference "real", or are they just due to
      chance?
    </p>

  </section>

  <section xml:id="sec-anovaintro">
    <title>How ANOVA Works</title>

    <p>
      In order to answer the question posed by our clinical trial data, we're going to run a
      one-way ANOVA. As usual, we're going to start by showing you how to do it the hard way to
      make sure you really understand how ANOVA works, but with CogStat, you'll never <em>ever</em>
      have do it this way.
    </p>

    <p>
      The experimental design strongly suggests that we're interested in comparing the average mood
      change for the three different drugs. In that sense, we're talking about an analysis similar
      to the <m>t</m>-test (<xref ref="ch-ttest"/>), but involving more than two groups. If we let
      <m>\mu_P</m> denote the population mean for the mood change induced by the placebo, and let
      <m>\mu_A</m> and <m>\mu_J</m> denote the corresponding means for our two drugs, Anxifree and
      Joyzepam, then the (somewhat pessimistic) null hypothesis that we want to test is that all
      three population means are identical: that is, <em>neither</em> of the two drugs is any more
      effective than a placebo.
    </p>

    <p>
      Sidenote. This assumption of equal variances is Fisher's ANOVA. When we are explicitly not
      assuming equal variances, we should be using Welch's ANOVA, but that's covered in this book
      or in CogStat actually.
    </p>

    <p>
      Back to our Fisher's one-way ANOVA. Mathematically, we write this null hypothesis like this:
      <me>
        \begin{array}{rcl}
        {H}_{0} \amp : \amp \mbox{it is true that } \mu_P = \mu_A = \mu_J
        \end{array}
      </me>
    </p>

    <p>
      As a consequence, our alternative hypothesis is that at least one of the three different
      treatments is different from the others. It's a little trickier to write this mathematically,
      because there are quite a few different ways in which the null hypothesis can be false. So
      for now we'll just write the alternative hypothesis like this:
      <me>
        \begin{array}{rcl}
        {H}_{1} \amp : \amp \mbox{it is \emph{not} true that } \mu_P = \mu_A = \mu_J
        \end{array}
      </me>
    </p>

    <p>
      This null hypothesis is a lot trickier to test than any of the ones we've seen previously.
      How shall we do it? A sensible guess would be to "do an ANOVA", since that's the title of
      the chapter, but it's not particularly clear why an "analysis of <em>variances</em>" will
      help us learn anything useful about the <em>means</em>. In fact, this is one of the greatest
      conceptual difficulties that people have when first encountering ANOVA. To see how this
      works, let us talk about variances first.
    </p>

    <subsection xml:id="subsec-anova-fromvariance">
      <title>From Variance...</title>

      <p>
        We'll use <m>G</m> to refer to the total number of groups. For our data set, there are
        three drugs, so there are <m>G=3</m> groups. Next, we'll use <m>N</m> to refer to the
        total sample size: there are a total of <m>N=18</m> people in our data set. Similarly,
        let's use <m>N_k</m> to denote the number of people in the <m>k</m>-th group. In our fake
        clinical trial, the sample size is <m>N_k = 6</m> for all three groups.<fn>When all groups
        have the same number of observations, the experimental design is said to be "balanced".
        Balance isn't such a big deal for one-way ANOVA but becomes more important when you start
        doing more complicated ANOVAs.</fn> Finally, we'll use <m>Y</m> to denote the outcome
        variable (mood change). Specifically, we'll use <m>Y_{ik}</m> to refer to the mood change
        experienced by the <m>i</m>-th member of the <m>k</m>-th group. Similarly, we'll use
        <m>\bar{Y}</m> to be the average mood change, taken across all 18 people in the
        experiment, and <m>\bar{Y}_k</m> to refer to the average mood change experienced by the 6
        people in group <m>k</m>.
      </p>

      <p>
        Excellent. Now that we've got our notation sorted out, we can start writing down formulas.
        To start with, let's recall the formula for the variance that we used earlier in the book,
        way back in those kinder days when we were just doing descriptive statistics. The sample
        variance of <m>Y</m> is defined as follows:
        <me>
          \mbox{Var}(Y) = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{k=1}^G \sum_{i=1}^{N_k} \left(Y_{ik} - \bar{Y} \right)^2
        </me>
        This formula looks pretty much identical to the formula for the variance from descriptive
        statistics. The only difference is that we are now summing over groups (i.e. values for
        <m>k</m>) and over the people within the groups (i.e. values for <m>i</m>).
      </p>

      <p>
        Let's consider a simple table to see how this formula works on our clinical trial data set.
        The table below shows the person, the drug they were given, and their mood change.
      </p>

      <p>
        Our average mood change is the mean of all the mood changes in the data set (which you can
        see if you run <c>Explore variable</c> for <c>mood_gain</c>), which is <m>\bar{Y} = 0.88</m>.
        The variance of the mood changes is the sum of the squared differences between each mood
        change and the average mood change, divided by the total number of observations. So our
        formula filled in would look like this:

        Fortunately, we don't have to do these manually.<fn>You went into Excel and did it
        manually, and got the same answer, great! No, you used the <c>VAR.P</c> function and got
        the same answer. Great! Wait, you used the <c>VAR.S</c> and got <m>0.285</m>? Something's
        not right. You went to jamovi or JASP or SPSS (because you're fancy) and got <m>0.285</m>.
        What happened? There is a difference between population variance and estimated variance.
        The population variance is the variance of the population based on the fact you know all
        members of the population <mdash/> which is the case in our example, as we need the
        population variance of our trial, not the population to which the trial results will extend
        to. The estimated variance is always going to be a little bit bigger than the population
        variance, because it's an estimate, and uses a slightly different formula. Namely, it
        multiplies by <m>\frac{1}{N-1}</m>, not <m>\frac{1}{N}</m>.</fn>

    <subsection xml:id="subsec-anova-totalss">
      <title>...to Total Sum of Squares</title>

      <p>
        Okay, now that we've got a good grasp on how the population variance is calculated, let's
        define something called the <term>total sum of squares</term>, which is denoted
        <m>\mbox{SS}_{tot}</m>. This is very simple: instead of averaging the squared deviations,
        which is what we do when calculating the variance, we just add them up. So the formula for
        the total sum of squares is almost identical to the formula for the variance:
        <me>
          \mbox{SS}_{tot} = \sum_{k=1}^G \sum_{i=1}^{N_k} \left(Y_{ik} - \bar{Y} \right)^2
        </me>
        When we talk about analysing variances in the context of ANOVA, what we're really doing is
        working with the total sums of squares rather than the actual variance. One very nice thing
        about the total sum of squares is that we can break it up into two different kinds of
        variation. Firstly, we can talk about the <term>within-group sum of squares</term>, in
        which we look to see how different each individual person is from their own group mean:
        <me>
          \mbox{SS}_w = \sum_{k=1}^G \sum_{i=1}^{N_k} \left( Y_{ik} - \bar{Y}_k \right)^2
        </me>
        where <m>\bar{Y}_k</m> is a group mean.
      </p>

      <p>
        In our example, <m>\bar{Y}_k</m> would be the average mood change experienced by those
        people given the <m>k</m>-th drug. So, instead of comparing individuals to the average of
        <em>all</em> people in the experiment, we're only comparing them to those people in the
        same group. As a consequence, you'd expect the value of <m>\mbox{SS}_w</m> to be smaller
        than the total sum of squares, because it's completely ignoring any group differences
        <mdash/> that is, the fact that the drugs (if they work) will have different effects on
        people's moods.
      </p>

      <p>
        Next, we can define a third notion of variation which captures <em>only</em> the
        differences <em>between groups</em>. We do this by looking at the differences between the
        group means <m>\bar{Y}_k</m> and grand mean <m>\bar{Y}</m>. In order to quantify the
        extent of this variation, what we do is calculate the <term>between-group sum of
        squares</term>:
        <md>
          <mrow>
            \mbox{SS}_{b} \amp = \sum_{k=1}^G \sum_{i=1}^{N_k} \left( \bar{Y}_k - \bar{Y} \right)^2
          </mrow>
          <mrow>
            \amp = \sum_{k=1}^G N_k \left( \bar{Y}_k - \bar{Y} \right)^2
          </mrow>
        </md>
      </p>

      <p>
        It's not too difficult to show that the total variation among people in the experiment
        <m>\mbox{SS}_{tot}</m> is actually the sum of the differences between the groups
        <m>\mbox{SS}_b</m> and the variation inside the groups <m>\mbox{SS}_w</m>. That is:
        <me>
          \mbox{SS}_w  + \mbox{SS}_{b} = \mbox{SS}_{tot}
        </me>
      </p>

      <p>
        Yay.
      </p>

      <figure xml:id="fig-anovavara">
        <caption>Graphical illustration of "between-groups" variation.</caption>
        <image source="anovavara-1.svg"/>
      </figure>

      <figure xml:id="fig-anovavarb">
        <caption>Graphical illustration of "within groups" variation.</caption>
        <image source="anovavarb-1.svg"/>
      </figure>

      <p>
        Okay, so what have we found out?
      </p>

      <p>
        We've discovered that the total variability associated with the outcome variable
        (<m>\mbox{SS}_{tot}</m>) can be mathematically carved up into the sum of "the variation
        due to the differences in the sample means for the different groups" (<m>\mbox{SS}_{b}</m>)
        plus "all the rest of the variation" (<m>\mbox{SS}_{w}</m>).
      </p>

      <p>
        Let's apply the formulas to our clinical trial example, and see what we get. We won't
        bother with the calculations in details, because the formula is given, and CogStat will
        not bore you with these either.
      </p>

      <md>
        <mrow>
          \mbox{SS}_w \amp = \sum_{k=1}^G \sum_{i=1}^{N_k} \left( Y_{ik} - \bar{Y}_k \right)^2
        </mrow>
        <mrow>
          \amp = 1.3917
        </mrow>
      </md>

      <md>
        <mrow>
          \mbox{SS}_b \amp = \sum_{k=1}^G N_k \left( \bar{Y}_k - \bar{Y} \right)^2
        </mrow>
        <mrow>
          \amp = 3.4533
        </mrow>
      </md>

      <p>
        How does that help me find out whether the groups have different population means? If the
        null hypothesis is true, then you'd expect all the sample means to be pretty similar to
        each other, right? And that would imply that you'd expect <m>\mbox{SS}_{b}</m> to be
        really small, or at least you'd expect it to be a lot smaller than the "the variation
        associated with everything else", <m>\mbox{SS}_{w}</m>.
      </p>

      <p>
        So, let's do a hypothesis test to validate.
      </p>

    </subsection>

    <subsection xml:id="subsec-anova-ftest">
      <title>From Sums of Squares to the <m>F</m>-Test</title>

      <p>
        As we saw in the last section, the <em>qualitative</em> idea behind ANOVA is to compare
        the two sums of squares values <m>\mbox{SS}_b</m> and <m>\mbox{SS}_w</m> to each other:
        if the between-group variation <m>\mbox{SS}_b</m> is large relative to the within-group
        variation <m>\mbox{SS}_w</m>, then we have reason to suspect that the population means for
        the different groups aren't identical to each other.
      </p>

      <p>
        Our test statistic is called an <term><m>F</m>-ratio</term>. It's defined as the ratio of
        the between-group variation to the within-group variation.
      </p>

      <p>
        In order to convert our SS values into an <m>F</m>-ratio, the first thing we need to
        calculate is the <term>degrees of freedom</term> associated with the SS<m>_b</m> and
        SS<m>_w</m> values. As usual, the degrees of freedom corresponds to the number of unique
        "data points" that contribute to a particular calculation, minus the number of
        "constraints" that they need to satisfy.
      </p>

      <p>
        For the within-groups variability, what we're calculating is the variation of the
        individual observations (<m>N</m> data points) around the group means (<m>G</m>
        constraints). In contrast, for the between-groups variability, we're interested in the
        variation of the group means (<m>G</m> data points) around the grand mean (1 constraint).
        Therefore, the degrees of freedom here are:
        <md>
          <mrow>
            \mbox{df}_b \amp = G-1
          </mrow>
          <mrow>
            \mbox{df}_w \amp = N-G
          </mrow>
        </md>
      </p>

      <p>
        What we do next is convert our summed squares value into a "mean squares" value, which we
        do by dividing by the degrees of freedom:
        <md>
          <mrow>
            \mbox{MS}_b \amp = \displaystyle\frac{\mbox{SS}_b }{ \mbox{df}_b}
          </mrow>
          <mrow>
            \mbox{MS}_w \amp = \displaystyle\frac{\mbox{SS}_w }{ \mbox{df}_w}
          </mrow>
        </md>
      </p>

      <p>
        Finally, we calculate the <m>F</m>-ratio by dividing the between-groups MS by the
        within-groups MS:
        <me>
          F = \frac{\mbox{MS}_b }{ \mbox{MS}_w }
        </me>
      </p>

      <p>
        At a very general level, the intuition behind the <m>F</m> statistic is straightforward:
        bigger values of <m>F</m> means that the between-groups variation is large, relative to
        the within-groups variation. As a consequence, the larger the value of <m>F</m>, the more
        evidence we have against the null hypothesis. (To read more on how large does <m>F</m>
        have to be to reject the null hypothesis, see the next chapter.)
      </p>

      <p>
        In order to complete our hypothesis test, we need to know the sampling distribution for
        <m>F</m> if the null hypothesis is true. Not surprisingly, the sampling distribution for
        the <m>F</m> <em>statistic</em> under the null hypothesis is an <m>F</m>
        <em>distribution</em>. As seen in the probability chapter, the <m>F</m> distribution has
        two parameters, corresponding to the two degrees of freedom involved: the first one
        df<m>_1</m> is the between-groups degrees of freedom df<m>_b</m>, and the second one
        df<m>_2</m> is the within-groups degrees of freedom df<m>_w</m>.

      <title>Further Reading: The Meaning of <m>F</m> (Advanced)</title>

      <p>
        At a fundamental level, ANOVA is a competition between two different statistical models,
        <m>H_0</m> and <m>H_1</m>. If you recall, our null hypothesis was that all of the group
        means are identical to one another. If so, then a natural way to think about the outcome
        variable <m>Y_{ik}</m> is to describe individual scores in terms of a single population
        mean <m>\mu</m>, plus the deviation from that population mean. This deviation is usually
        denoted <m>\epsilon_{ik}</m> and is traditionally called the <em>error</em> or
        <term>residual</term> associated with that observation. Be careful though: just like we
        saw with the word "significant", the word "error" has a technical meaning in statistics
        that isn't quite the same as its everyday English definition. The word "residual" is a
        better term than the word "error". In statistics, both words mean "leftover variability":
        that is, "stuff" that the model can't explain.
      </p>

      <p>
        In any case, here's what the null hypothesis looks like when we write it as a statistical
        model:
        <me>
          Y_{ik} = \mu + \epsilon_{ik}
        </me>
        where we make the <em>assumption</em> that the residual values <m>\epsilon_{ik}</m> are
        normally distributed, with mean 0 and a standard deviation <m>\sigma</m> that is the same
        for all groups. To use the notation that we introduced in the probability chapter we would
        write this assumption like this:
        <me>
          \epsilon_{ik} \sim \mbox{Normal}(0, \sigma^2)
        </me>
      </p>

      <p>
        What about the alternative hypothesis, <m>H_1</m>? The only difference between the null
        hypothesis and the alternative hypothesis is that we allow each group to have a different
        population mean. So, if we let <m>\mu_k</m> denote the population mean for the <m>k</m>-th
        group in our experiment, then the statistical model corresponding to <m>H_1</m> is:
        <me>
          Y_{ik} = \mu_k + \epsilon_{ik}
        </me>
        where, once again, we assume that the error terms are normally distributed with mean 0 and
        standard deviation <m>\sigma</m>. That is, the alternative hypothesis also assumes that
        <me>
          \epsilon \sim \mbox{Normal}(0, \sigma^2)
        </me>
      </p>

      <p>
        Okay, now that we've described the statistical models underpinning <m>H_0</m> and
        <m>H_1</m> in more detail, it's now pretty straightforward to say what the mean square
        values are measuring and what this means for the interpretation of <m>F</m>.
      </p>

      <p>
        It turns out that the within-groups mean square, MS<m>_w</m>, can be viewed as an
        estimator (in the technical sense: see the estimation chapter) of the error variance
        <m>\sigma^2</m>. The between-groups mean square MS<m>_b</m> is also an estimator; but
        what it estimates is the error variance <em>plus</em> a quantity that depends on the true
        differences among the group means. If we call this quantity <m>Q</m>, then we can see that
        the <m>F</m>-statistic is basically
        <me>
          F = \frac{\hat{Q} + \hat\sigma^2}{\hat\sigma^2}
        </me>
        where the true value <m>Q=0</m> if the null hypothesis is true, and <m>Q > 0</m> if the
        alternative hypothesis is true <xref ref="Hays1994"/>. Therefore, at a bare minimum
        <em>the <m>F</m> value must be larger than 1</em> to have any chance of rejecting the
        null hypothesis. Note that this <em>doesn't</em> mean that it's impossible to get an
        <m>F</m>-value less than 1. What it means is that, if the null hypothesis is true the
        sampling distribution of the <m>F</m> ratio has a mean of 1,<fn>Or, more accurately,
        <m>1 + \frac{2}{df_2 - 2}</m>.</fn> and so we need to see <m>F</m>-values larger than 1
        in order to safely reject the null.
      </p>

      <p>
        To be a bit more precise about the sampling distribution, notice that if the null
        hypothesis is true, both MS<m>_b</m> and MS<m>_w</m> are estimators of the variance of
        the residuals <m>\epsilon_{ik}</m>. If those residuals are normally distributed, then you
        might suspect that the estimate of the variance of <m>\epsilon_{ik}</m> is chi-square
        distributed. Because that's what a chi-square distribution <em>is</em>: it's what you get
        when you square a bunch of normally-distributed things and add them up. And since the
        <m>F</m> distribution is (again, by definition) what you get when you take the ratio
        between two things that are <m>\chi^2</m> distributed, we have our sampling distribution.

    <title>Interpreting Our Results in CogStat</title>

    <p>
      You already know the answers because we calculated it step by step, but you have a more
      in-depth understanding of how it all ties together. CogStat will do all of this for you, but
      it's good to know what's going on behind the scenes. Let's see how CogStat displays our
      data.

    <p>
      So what we had to do, was simply run the <c>Compare groups</c> function with
      <c>mood_gain</c> by <c>drug</c>.

      We've seen this before. Let us explore the hypothesis test results.

      </tabular>
    </table>

    <p>
      For now, let's stop here. We'll come back to the post hoc tests later. For now, let's just
      focus on the hypothesis test results. We can see that the Shapiro-Wilk normality test was
      run on each of the groups. Testing the normality assumption is relatively straightforward. We
      covered the theory behind it in <xref ref="sec-shapiro"/>. The Levene test was run to check
      for homogeneity of variance across groups. The one-way ANOVA was run, and the result was
      that the <m>F</m>-value was 18.61, and the <m>p</m>-value was less than 0.001.
    </p>

    <p>
      At this point, we're basically done. (If you ran the test with us, you've seen something
      about post hoc tests. We will discuss them later.) Having completed our calculations, it's
      traditional to organise all these numbers into an ANOVA table like the one in
      <xref ref="tbl-anovatableresults"/>. For our clinical trial data, the ANOVA table would look
      like this:
    </p>

    <table xml:id="tbl-anovatableresults">

          <cell>--</cell>
          <cell>--</cell>
        </row>
      </tabular>
    </table>

    <p>
      CogStat doesn't produce this table for you or give the sums of squares or mean squares. But
      actually, you don't need it to understand what the statistic tells you. There's almost never
      a good reason to include the whole table in your write-up, but you might see it in other
      statistical software.
    </p>

    <p>
      A pretty standard way of reporting this result would be to write something like this:
    </p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>One-way ANOVA showed a significant effect of drug on mood gain (<em>F</em>(2,15) = 18.61,
      <em>p</em> &lt; .001).</p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>
      Sigh. So much work for one short sentence (if you do it manually).
